## OBD-Dash

A javascript server for handling realtime sensor data from OBD-II vehicle ports. Works with ELM327 OBD-II adapters, and is fit for the Raspberry Pi.

## Motivation

My motivation for this project was to find a use for my raspberry Pi. Like many other Pi owners I tend to buy more than I use. I was inspired by this [project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUa8MFtMCP0) and wanted to see if I could go a little bit further.
